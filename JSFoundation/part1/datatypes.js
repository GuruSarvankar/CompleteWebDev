 Undefined  - which means var has been declared but not assign the value
 null       - represent intentional absense of any value. var should have no value or when an 
              object is expected but not yet available.
              eg. imagine you are booking a hotel room online. Initially you havent selected any
              rooms, so the var storing your room is null. It means there is no rooms selected yet,
              but it is expected that you will select one.
